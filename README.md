# Vantage

Same application. Brand new point of view.

    npm install vantage

Vantage provides a distributed, interactive command-line interface to your live Node application or web server.

####Doesn't commander.js do that?

Yes, and no. Inspired by and based on [commander.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander), Vantage allows you to connect into and hop between running Node applications with an interactive prompt provided by [inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).
